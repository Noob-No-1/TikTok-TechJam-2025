      "- i really love my new lincoln mkc. at first, they didn't have the color i wanted so they got it from a dealership 500 miles away at no cost to me!! not a lot of dealerships do that. quality customer service! devon knew everything about the vehicle and if he didn't, he found out what the answer was right away. devon also didn't put any pressure on me to buy. i took my own pace and i'm very thankful. dave nick did an awesome job explaining all the paperwork and making it a very easy process.\n",
      "- wasn't as pleased with this place as i was online. great location and things look really nice. however, or shower was dirty and the walls are kinda of hear through. could hear the tv next door. the staff were friendly. and they did a decent job with a covid breakfast. but over all i don't believe i would stay again. which makes me sad because it is in a great spot!\n",
      "- i was in complete awe just walking through the front door. it probably weighs over 500 lbs. the interior is a museum filled with stuffed animals in showcases and hung all over the walls. i had no time to visit the gift shop. oh, let's not forget about the food, it's superb. i've never had anything else like it and the service is up to par with any upscale restaurant, but cozy and country feeling. i ordered the steak and eggs with hash browns. i think they cook everything with butter because it was so delicious and tender. i can't say enough good things about this place. check out the door handles, they are actual traps.\n",

      "i just read some other reviews and let me tell you, the place was relatively empty when i ate there, so there was no wait time to get a table and menus. the 2 young waitresses were going back and forth the whole time with the few other tables they had. my co worker and i had just come off the drilling rig from a 24 hour job and were really hungry, tired and cranky. the waitress forgot to add bacon to one of the orders, but we were so pleased with everything else that we didn't fuss about it, but when we mentioned it to the waitress she was very apologetic and gave us pie at no charge.\n",
